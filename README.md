### End to End Maching Learning Project - Student Performance Predictor

## Introduction
This is an End to End Production Grade Data Science Project.
This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.
Based on these Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation courses, we will predict the students' performance.

## Project Description
The project covers Data preprocessing, Model training, Hyperparameter Tunning and Evaluation.
Main focus areas: Modular Coding, MLops, Cloud Services, and CI/CD.
Utilizes Custom Exception handling mechanisms and custom logs to record each action.
Implemented using Industry Standard Folder Structure.
Research conducted using Jupyter Notebook and stored in the Notebook folder.

## Backend
Flask web Framework

## Frontend
HTML & CSS

## Dataset
Source: - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977

Description: The dataset contains 1000 instances with 8 parameters.

Preprocessing: Missing values were imputed, and categorical features were encoded using One Hot Encoding. And also use StandardScaler for standardization.

## Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized distributions and correlations. The EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE.ipynb file shows the visualization part.
Feature Engineering: Created new features based on existing data.
Modeling: Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, XGBRegressor, AdaBoost Regressor models. Hyperparameter Tunning is done for all models.
Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision and R2-score to evaluate models.
